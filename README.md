# Enron-Machine-Learning

### Applying Machine Learning to Enron Persons of Interest

#### Project 4 in my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

This project is my first foray into Machine Learning, one of the most intriguing areas of data analysis. I analyze financial and email features using various machine learning algorithms to predict whether an Enron employee should be considered a person of interest. The algorithm is based on the employees that have already been identified as persons of interest (e.g. Ken Lay).

My final writeup for the project is in _Enron POI Final Report.pdf_. The python script _poi_id.py_ includes the feature and algorithm selection and tuning process. _Tester.py_ tests the accuracy, precision, and recall of the machine learning algorithm using the pickle (.pkl) files.
